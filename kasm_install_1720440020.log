warrant that the software will operate uninterrupted or that it will be free from defects or that it will

6. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INDEMNIFICATION 

6.1.  Defense and Indemnification. Kasm Technologies shall defend You against any third party 
claim that the Software infringes any patent, trademark or copyright of such third party, or 
misappropriates a trade secret (but only to the extent that the misappropriation is not a result of Your 
actions) and indemnify You from the resulting costs and damages finally awarded against You to 
such third party by a court of competent jurisdiction or agreed to in settlement. The foregoing 
obligations are applicable only if You: (i) promptly notify Kasm Technologies in writing of the 
Infringement Claim; (ii) allow Kasm Technologies sole control over the defense for the claim, any 
settlement negotiations and any related action challenging the validity of the allegedly infringed 
patent, trademark, or copyright; and (iii) reasonably cooperate in response to Kasm Technologies 
requests for assistance. You may not settle or compromise any Infringement Claim without the prior 
written consent of Kasm Technologies.  

6.2.  Remedies. If the alleged infringing Software become, or in Kasm Technologies’ opinion be likely 
to become, the subject of an Infringement Claim, Kasm Technologies will, at Kasm Technologies’ 
option and expense, do one of the following: (a) procure the rights necessary for You to make 
continued use of the affected Software; (b) replace or modify the affected Software to make it non-
infringing; or (c) terminate the License to the affected Software and discontinue the related support 
services, and, upon Your certified deletion of the affected Software, refund: (i) the fees paid by You 
for the License to the affected Software, less straight-line depreciation over a three (3) year useful life 
beginning on the date such Software was delivered; and (ii) any pre-paid service fee attributable to 
related support services to be delivered after the date such service is stopped.  

6.3.  Exclusions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Kasm Technologies will have no obligation under 
this Section 8 (Intellectual Property Indemnification) or otherwise with respect to any claim based on: 
(a) a combination of Software with non-Kasm Technologies products (other than non-Kasm 
Technologies products that are listed on the Order and used in an unmodified form); (b) use for a 
purpose or in a manner for which the Software was not designed; (c) use of any older version of the 
Software when use of a newer Kasm Technologies version would have avoided the infringement; (d) 
any modification to the Software made without Kasm Technologies’ express written approval; (e) any 
claim that relates to open source software or freeware technology or any derivatives or other 
adaptations thereof that is not embedded by Kasm Technologies into Software; or (f) any Software 
provided on a no charge or evaluation basis. This Section 8 (intellectual property indemnification) 
states your sole and exclusive remedy and Kasm Technologies’ entire liability for any infringement 
claims or actions.  

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY 

7.1.  Limitation of Liability. To the maximum extent mandated by law, in no event will Kasm 
Technologies and its licensors be liable for any lost profits or business opportunities, loss of use, loss 
of revenue, loss of goodwill, business interruption, loss of data, or any indirect, special, incidental, or 
consequential damages under any theory of liability, whether based in contract, tort, negligence, 
product liability, or otherwise. Because some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of 
liability for consequential or incidental damages, the preceding limitation may not apply to you. Kasm 
Technologies’ and its licensors’ liability under this EULA will not, in any event, regardless of whether 
the claim is based in contract, tort, strict liability, or otherwise, exceed the greater of the license fees 
you paid for the software giving rise to the claim or $100. The foregoing limitations shall apply 
regardless of whether Kasm Technologies or its licensors have been advised of the possibility of such 
damages and regardless of whether any remedy fails of its essential purpose. You may not bring a 
claim under this EULA more than twelve (12) months after the cause of action arises. 

7.2.  Indemnification. You agree to indemnify and hold Kasm Technologies and its parents, 
subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, employees, agents, partners and licensors (if any) harmless from any 
claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, due to or arising out of your: (a) use of the 
Software; (b) violation of this agreement or any law or regulation; or (c) violation of any right of a third 
party.

purposes of this EULA and who are under a duty of confidentiality no less restrictive than Recipient’s 
duty hereunder. Recipient will protect Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access, or
